#colors: 1=NIR, 2=red, 3=blue, when a "color" is in 1, everything that reflects a lot that color will be highlighted
#in the 2006 image water is blue and in 1982 looked white, because in 1982 there was a higher concentration of soil particles dispersed in the water, so the reflectance changed.
#NIR cannot be seen with our eyes. question: how to be sure the two images are from the same area? Rivers are not a good choice as they tend to repeat their shapes (fractals), so in this case take the road that cuts through the forest
#clearly, if we see geometrically simple plots, it's probably man made. Fractal shapes are instead typical of nature.
#DVI is an index of reflectance, DVI=NIR-red, calculated as sottrazione of one color reflectance from a second color reflectance.
#In this process, we make this calculation for every single pixel
